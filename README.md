# AtliQ_Hardware_Sales_And_Finance_Analysis_Excel

AtliQ Hardware has seen significant growth recently and has chosen to prepare P & L report for data analytics to compare their market competitors and base their decisions on data insights. This initiative is designed to answer stakeholder questions across all key areas ensuring well-informed and strategic decision-making.

# Project Overview:
-----------------------
The project focuses on organizing and analyzing a massive dataset with over 500,000 messy sales records. The aim is to uncover valuable insights that can help AtliQ hardware make smarter decisions and keep track of important performance metrics. Ultimately, the goal is to significantly boost the company’s overall performance, particularly in terms of net sales and gross margin.

As part of this project, I focus on analyzing key financial metrics to help improve business decisions. One of the main tasks is calculating the gross margin percentage by quarter, providing a clear picture of profitability over time.

Additionally, I create detailed profit and loss (P&L) reports for different markets, which include net sales, cost of goods sold (COGS), and gross margin. This helps in understanding how each market is performing.

I also break down P&L data by month, offering insights into short-term performance. For a broader view, I generate fiscal year reports for each customer, giving a complete understanding of annual sales trends.

On top of that, I track net sales for various products and customers year-over-year, as well as across different markets. This comprehensive data analysis allows for more informed strategies that can significantly boost the company's performance.
